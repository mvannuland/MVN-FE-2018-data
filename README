Below is a brief description for each file [relevant tables/figures in brackets].

"Site, Plant trait, & Soil data.csv" - Environmental data, plant traits, and soil chemistry data collected from the field. [Associated with Table 1 and 2; Figures 1 and 2].

"Bioinformatics workflow.txt" - Code to process raw sequence reads (NCBI Accession: PRJNA503728).

"16S community data.csv" - Community data from OTU table. [Figure 1 and 2]

"Phylum abundance data.csv" - Bacteria and Archaea phylum abundances [Figure 1 and 4]

"Biomass growth data.csv" - Plant growth responses to the reciprocal transplant experiment. [Figure 3]

"Post-experiment soil nitrogen data" - Soil nitrogen measured at the end of the reciprocal transplant experiment. [Figure 3]

"Growth Fertilizer Exp" - Plant growth responses to fertilizer treatments in a separate experiment. [Supplemental information]

"Growth PostExpSoilNitrogen" - Comparison of the amount of soil nitrogen at the end of the experiment to plant growth responses in the experiment. [Supplemental information]

"Roots and mortality" - Additional data to test for effects of the reciprocal transplant on root traits and plant survival in the experiment.
